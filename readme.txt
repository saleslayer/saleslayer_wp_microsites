A simple and easy way to set up a website that shows your product catalog with all the information that you want in minutes!

== Description ==

Set up your microsite with your product catalog and show it to the world in minutes. Thanks to [Sales Layer PIM](https://saleslayer.com/) you can download your entire catalog with customizable information.
Enter your Sales Layer account and create a Wordpress connector, choose the fields you want to show, then go to Wordpress, click "Update Catalog" and that's it, your site is ready with all the products you chose to display.
The plug-in connects to the API with your credentials and downloads all the content you would like to display.
If you need to customise the plug-in you can fork the branch on [GitHub](https://github.com/saleslayer/Sales_Layer_Wordpress/).

*Finally, press Connect! to import categories, products and product variants automatically.
